# Generalized Segmentation Techniques
Comprehensive Analysis of Clustering Algorithms Using PCA-Binned Features for Optimal Customer Segmentation in Retail Data
Effective data segmentation is crucial for extracting meaningful insights across various fields. However, it presents significant challenges, including instability, interpretability, high dimensionality, sparse data, and skewed cluster sizes. To address these issues, this article proposes generalized methodologies for data segmentation using comprehensive clustering techniques. We discuss the technical aspects of data preparation and clustering to provide a comprehensive framework suitable for diverse applications.
To illustrate our approach, we include a case study where we segment customers based on their transaction purchase behavior. This example demonstrates the effectiveness of our generalized methodology in handling real-world data, providing actionable insights through robust data segmentation techniques.
